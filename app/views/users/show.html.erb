      In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language
      description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from
      the perspective of an end user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards, on
      st-it notes, or digitally in project management software[1] Depending on the project, user
      stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers, or development
       team members.
